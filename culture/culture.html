    <br>
    <p3>The concept of arranged marriage in India traces its origin to as early as the Vedic times. For royal families, <br>
a ceremony known as the 'Swayambar' would be arranged for the bride.Suitable matches from all over the kingdom <br>
were invited to either compete in some competition to win over the bride, or the bride would herself choose her <br>
ideal husband. Even today,the concept of arranged marriage remains a favourite among Indians and is an integral <br>
part of 'Indian Traditions'.<br></p3></div></div><br>

factors of India's popularity worldwide. The style of cooking varies from region to region, though unanimously, Indian<br>
food has a significant reputation for its extensive use of spices and herbs. Just like dances, religious practices, <br>
language and clothes, you will also find a wide variety of food throughout the country. Almost every region is known for <br>
